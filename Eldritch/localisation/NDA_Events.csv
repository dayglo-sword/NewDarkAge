EVTNAME94160;A New Dark Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94160;The world is changing. A New Age is beginning, and this will probably not be a good thing for the lonely planet.\n\nOver the course of the next century, Eldritch entities will emerge out of the depths of space and time, as they begin their corruption of humanity.\n\nSlowly at first, working in the shadows, but then accelerating their plans towards a final confrontation for the soul of the world.\n\nWill the Hasturians defy Cthuhlu and go it alone?\nWill the Mi-Go and their agents just sit by and watch?\nWill Herbert West pay his Miskatonic Library late fees?\n\nBased on vanilla Victoria 2 HoD for an authentic dystopian experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
