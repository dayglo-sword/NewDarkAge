EVTNAME94170;A Restless Sleep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94170;A noise wakes you from your slumber\n\nIn front of you is an hideous winged monstrosty.\n\n'We are the Mi-Go from Yuggoth, we have travelled far from your future to study these times.\n\nYou appear to be a likely candidate for our experiment. I will make you an offer...\nIn return for immortally you will agree to be our agent in these times...\nrecording the history of these dark times from the view point of the worlds leaders.\n\n'This will of course require a certain amount of surgery to get your brain where we need it.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94170A;Immortality sounds good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94170B;Hide Under the Bedsheets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94171;All A Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94171;You wake up in the morning to the smell of ozone and soiled bedsheets.\n\nThere are strange burn marks on the floor near your bed.\n\nYou doubt that anyone sane will believe your excuses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94171A;I Need Breakfast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94172;We Will Return;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94172;The Alien waves their appendages in approval and tells you that they will return within the decade to conduct the next stage of the experiment, when you will obtain your new body.\n\nBe careful not to die in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94172A;See You Soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94173;Time To Move On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94173;It is time. The Mi-go are implementing the next phase of their experiment and you will depart both your body and this land.\n\nThey transport you to their laboratory and prepare the canister where your brain will be hosed till they find a sutable victim for the next stage of the experiment.\n\nWill anybody in $COUNTRY$ notice that their leader is now a mindless husk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94173A;I Hate The Sound Of That Saw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94174;A New Place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTOPT94174A;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94175;A New Place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94175;After what seems like an eternity your brain is transplanted into a new victim.\n\nA new body and a new country awaits...\n\nWill anyone notice the change in the behaviour of their leader?\n\nWill they accept a new direction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94175A;Home Sweet Home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94176;The Crux of the Experiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94176;Once more in the night the thing has returned! As the world plunges towards it's final reckoning it speaks...\n\n'This is the exact point we were hoping to position you. No more switching from now, the experiment will succeed or fail based on your actions here.'\n\n'We will return at the end and reward you should you complete your role.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94176A;Just Need To Survive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94177;Your Reward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94177;For the final time your sleep is disturbed by the intruders...\n\n'We will in a while take you to the great library on Yuggoth, where, as promised, your brain tube will act as a permanent record of the experiment for all time.'\n\n'We are not totally heatless, we have selected another tube dweller to keep you company for eternity. They are an observer from an alternate Earth future who goes by the name of Drew...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94177A;Just Need To Survive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94178;A Bad Place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94178;The Mi-Go have left you in a dangerous situation.\n\nYou are now the advisor to the Mad Emperor, Castaigne, in the realm of Imperial America!\n\nWorse still, the Hasturians, followers of the King in Yellow, are the avowed enemies of the Mi-Go! You will need to tread carefully to maintain your cover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT94178A;Not Good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME94179;A Strange Place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC94179;The Mi-Go have placed you in a sticky situation.\n\nThe Cultists are in control of this country and you are now their leader!\n\nYou should be able to stave off the country's enevitable envelopment by the Eldritch forces but will the cultists accept this, or will they rise up with you becoming just another sacrifice to their vile gods?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
